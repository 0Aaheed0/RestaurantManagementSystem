Now that you have configured your database connection, you need to run the migrations to create the necessary tables in your 'campusmart' database.

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This will create the `users` table (and any other tables defined in your migrations) in your database. After this step is complete, your database will be ready for user registration and login.
