To connect your Laravel application to your 'campusmart' database, please follow these steps:

1.  **Open your `.env` file** in your project root directory (D:\CampusMart\cse-3100\.env).

2.  **Update your database settings.** Find the following lines and update them to match your 'campusmart' database configuration:

    ```
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=campusmart
    DB_USERNAME=your_mysql_username
    DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
    ```

    Replace `your_mysql_username` and `your_mysql_password` with your actual MySQL credentials.

3.  **Save the `.env` file.**

4.  **Clear Laravel's configuration cache** by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    php artisan config:clear
    ```

Once you have completed these steps, your application will be configured to use your 'campusmart' database.
